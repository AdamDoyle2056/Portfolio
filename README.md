## About Me  

I’m a final-year Computer Science student passionate about game development and creative software engineering.  
My focus is on building immersive gameplay systems, efficient code architectures, and clean, well-documented projects.

I’m currently:  
- Completing my final-year CS coursework  
- Developing a capstone Unity game 
- Preparing a portfolio to showcase technical and creative projects  

I’m open to opportunities in game development, tools engineering, or creative software roles where I can blend art, code, and systems thinking.
